# Authentication Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Environment-Based Password Configuration**

- Added `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD` environment variable with minimum 8 character validation
- Password is never hardcoded in the source code
- Environment validation ensures app won't run without proper configuration

### 2. **NextAuth.js Integration**

- Configured Credentials Provider for password-only authentication
- JWT-based session strategy (no database storage needed for sessions)
- Secure session management with automatic token refresh

### 3. **Protected Routes**

- **Middleware** (`src/middleware.ts`): Automatically redirects unauthenticated users from `/dashboard` to `/login`
- **Client-side protection**: Dashboard checks session and shows loading state
- **API protection**: Dashboard data endpoints now require authentication

### 4. **Login Flow**

- Clean login page with password-only form
- Real-time error handling
- Secure sign-in using NextAuth
- Automatic redirect to dashboard on success

### 5. **Logout Functionality**

- Sign out button in dashboard header
- Session destroyed on logout
- Redirects back to login page

### 6. **TRPC Route Protection**

- Protected dashboard data endpoints:
  - `getTotalResponseCount`
  - `getResponsesByDateRange`
  - `getGoogleRedirects`
- Public endpoints remain accessible (survey submission, form display)

## 🔐 Security Features

✅ **Environment Variables**: Password stored securely, never in code  
✅ **JWT Sessions**: Secure, stateless authentication  
✅ **CSRF Protection**: Built into NextAuth  
✅ **Route Protection**: Middleware prevents unauthorized access  
✅ **API Protection**: TRPC procedures check authentication  
✅ **Session Validation**: Automatic token verification on each request  
✅ **Secure Callbacks**: Proper session handling in callbacks

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

### New Files

- `src/middleware.ts` - Route protection middleware
- `AUTH_SETUP.md` - Detailed setup guide
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

### Modified Files

- `src/env.js` - Added DASHBOARD_PASSWORD validation
- `src/server/auth/config.ts` - Configured Credentials provider
- `src/app/login/page.tsx` - Integrated NextAuth signIn
- `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Added session checking and logout
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Wrapped app with SessionProvider
- `src/server/api/routers/survey.ts` - Protected dashboard endpoints
- `README.md` - Added authentication setup instructions

## 🚀 How to Use

### First Time Setup

1. Create `.env` file with required variables (see README.md)
2. Set `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD` to your chosen password
3. Generate `AUTH_SECRET` using `openssl rand -base64 32`
4. Start the development server: `pnpm dev`

### Login

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`
2. You'll be redirected to `/login`
3. Enter the password you set in `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD`
4. On success, you'll be redirected to the dashboard

### Session Persistence

- Your session persists across page refreshes
- Session is stored securely as an HTTP-only cookie
- No need to log in again until you sign out or session expires

### Logout

- Click the "Sign Out" button in the dashboard header
- Session is destroyed and you're redirected to login

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Can access login page without authentication
- [ ] Entering wrong password shows error
- [ ] Entering correct password redirects to dashboard
- [ ] Dashboard shows loading state during auth check
- [ ] Dashboard data loads after authentication
- [ ] Refreshing dashboard page maintains session
- [ ] Directly accessing `/dashboard` when logged out redirects to login
- [ ] Sign out button logs out and redirects to login
- [ ] After logout, accessing dashboard redirects to login
- [ ] TRPC endpoints return UNAUTHORIZED when not authenticated

## 📝 Environment Variables Required

```env
# Required for authentication
AUTH_SECRET="generated-random-string"
DASHBOARD_PASSWORD="your-secure-password"

# Other required variables
DATABASE_URL="file:./prisma/db.sqlite"
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"
NODE_ENV="development"
```

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices Followed

1. ✅ No hardcoded passwords
2. ✅ Password stored in environment variables
3. ✅ Minimum password length enforced
4. ✅ Secure session management (JWT)
5. ✅ HTTP-only cookies
6. ✅ CSRF protection
7. ✅ Route-level protection
8. ✅ API-level protection
9. ✅ Client-side protection
10. ✅ Proper error handling

## 🔮 Future Enhancements (Optional)

If you need more security in the future, consider:

- Rate limiting on login attempts
- Password complexity requirements
- Session timeout configuration
- IP-based restrictions
- Two-factor authentication
- Audit logging
- Multiple user support with password hashing

## 📞 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Invalid password" with correct password

**Solution**: Ensure `.env` is in root directory and restart dev server

### Issue: Constant redirects to login

**Solution**: Check browser console for errors, verify `AUTH_SECRET` is set

### Issue: Session not persisting

**Solution**: Clear browser cookies, check `AUTH_SECRET` is properly set

### Issue: TRPC UNAUTHORIZED errors

**Solution**: Ensure you're logged in and session is valid

## 🎯 Summary

You now have a fully functional, secure password-based authentication system that:

- ✅ Uses a single password to protect the dashboard
- ✅ Follows security best practices
- ✅ Integrates seamlessly with NextAuth.js
- ✅ Protects both routes and API endpoints
- ✅ Provides a smooth user experience
- ✅ Is production-ready with proper configuration
