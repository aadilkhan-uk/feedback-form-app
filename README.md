# Feedback Form App

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

# About the app

This application was created as a pilot, as a way for Choppaluna (Wembley) to get increase customer feedback responses and Google Reviews. 

The idea is to streamline access to a web feedback form and use simple questions to gauge customer opinion. Using this feedback, an LLM is used to generate a review that the user can easily leave on Google. 

The app can be accessed here: https://feedback-form-app-j6is.vercel.app/feedback-form

# Results 

The pilot lasted 1 month and we found an 12% increase in Google Reviews compared to a 3 month average of the months before the Pilot. 
Choppaluna also recieved ~200 feedback form responses, allowing management to identify areas of strengths and weaknesses.
